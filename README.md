# interview_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:
It was a task for a flutter internship interview. An invoice generator software UI. Didn't completed 100% of task. Failed to generate List View Inside Navigation bar and the Home page UI design was kinda complicated. Hopefully you'll like it. 
Thank you
